# Project info:

-Finished successfully, but I didn't implement Point 8 in the assignment (implementing *localStorage*) due to my need to advance in the curriculum. There are also some visual aspects of the site I wish to polish, but I am tired of this project and eager to work on something new and keep learning. I will revisit this soon though!
